#How to install the power tools on your server

= Installation guide =

== Get the code == 
First get the code from the repository following the guidance at 
http://code.google.com/p/tridion-2011-power-tools/source/checkout

These instructions will assume that you have checked out the power tools to the following directory: 

*C:\powertools*

It is also assumed that Tridion is installed in the default location for 64 bit Windows. 

== Add a virtual directory in IIS == 
Open the IIS management snap-in. 
Open the Tridion web site, and within it find the following location: 

*WebUI/Editors*

Create a new virtual directory within Editors, called PowerTools2011
Configure its physical path to be:

*C:\powertools\!PowerTools2011 - Editor\*

(The name and location of the virtual directory are referenced in the configuration. See below.)

== Edit the Tridion GUI Extensions configuration == 

Open the configuration file: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Tridion\web\WebUI\WebRoot\Configuration\System.config

Locate the `<editors/>` element and add the power tools editor.

{{{
    <editor name="PowerTools2011" xmlns="http://www.sdltridion.com/2009/GUI/Configuration">
      <installpath>C:\powertools\PowerTools2011 - Editor\</installpath>
      <configuration>Configuration\editor.config</configuration>
      <vdir >PowerTools2011</vdir>
    </editor>
}}}
