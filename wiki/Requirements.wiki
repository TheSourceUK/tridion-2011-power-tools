= Candidates =
Not all extensions are PowerTools, but with other extension work needing similar setups (and being developed by the same community), it makes sense to collect "PowerTool candidates" here. Feel free to add and update suggestions here.

If there's interest, move up useful ideas up to the above list. At some point we can create a separate extensions group, discussion, or wiki.

  * Chris Summers brainstormed an idea with the Skype group for a micro-site publisher functionality that would take a zip file possibly from a third-party and publish it out to a site. This could be done via variants, treating the zip as a multimedia component but alternatives exist.
   * Note from Julian. I demo'ed this to HP using Dreamweaver as the entry point. Works quite OK but is a technical person's way of getting a microsite imported and published. If the DW import API could be utilized :)
