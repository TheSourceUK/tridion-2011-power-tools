=Next Steps=
Next steps you can take:
  * ~~Develop code against Core Service API to prep for Web service versions later (see discussion group for details)~~ We're back on track with an MVC model again.
  * Check out !ImageUploader !PowerTool (or any of the other new ones) and its Schema dropdown
  * Review Anguilla controls
  * Document [Requirements requirements] (function, design, fields, permissions, drop-downs, etc)
  * Identify what development side you're interested/comfortable with:
    * *Webservice* back-end (Webservices, Core API, etc)
    * *Client-side UI* (JavaScript, CSS, and XHTML)
    * *Client-side Logic* (JQuery/JavaScript by implication)
