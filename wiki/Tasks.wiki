New contributors and interests (since retreat):
  * Kunal Shetye, Count Items and GUI framework
  * Vikas Kumar, 2009 !PowerTools, waiting on 2011 (maybe we can add info here)
  * Raúl Escudero, Access permissions manager, Access Explorer, or (possibly easier) Xml Viewer/Xpath searcher

  * Ángel Puntero, Show Lists and Component Synchronizer
  * Robert Curlette, Component Publisher and Unlocalize Children (new)
  * Graeme Wigglesworth, available to help (don't hesitate to ask!)
Popular/requested tools:
  * Page Publisher (search helps replace functionality, but progress visualization, status, and smaller transport package features are still useful)
  * Component Synchronizer (in high-demand!)
  * (new suggestion) Component Publisher, (search helps replace functionality, but component publisher useful for Tridion folder publish)
  * (new suggestion) Field Content Copier
  * (new suggestion) Unlocalize Children based on URI

Next steps you can take:
  * Develop code against Core Service API to prep for Web service versions later (see discussion group for details)
  * Check out !ImageUploader !PowerTool and its Schema dropdown
  * Review Anguilla controls
  * Document requirements (function, design, fields, permissions, drop-downs, etc)
  * Identify what development side you're interested/comfortable with: Webservice back-end (Webservices, Core API, etc), Client-side UI (JavaScript and HTML?), Client-side Logic (JavaScript)

Next steps:
  * Release install guide
  * Re-organize priority (Page Publisher back on list)
  * Identify new tasks
  * Confirm assignments (most have volunteered for certain tools)
