=Next Steps=

Individual steps you can take:
  * Get comfortable with the MVC model and Anguilla framework by checking out the !ImageUploader !PowerTool (or any of the examples)
  * Review Anguilla controls
  * Document [Requirements requirements] (function, design, fields, permissions, drop-downs, etc)
  * Consider which part of development you're interested/comfortable with:
    * *Webservice* back-end (Webservices, Core API, etc)
    * *Client-side UI* (JavaScript, CSS, and XHTML)
    * *Client-side Logic* (JQuery/JavaScript by implication)

We need your help building out the Wiki, especially helping with troubleshooting and how-to guides.
