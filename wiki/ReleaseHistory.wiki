#summary Updates - Latest Version

== Disclaimer ==
As a set of extensions without support from a commercial organization, the Tridion PowerTools are released "as is" and user assumes all responsibility for their use.

=== Open Source Project ===
The source code is open and  developed, supported, and updated by a community open to Tridion developers, consultants, partners, and customers.

The current PowerTools version requires Tridion Content Management System configuration and a manual installation of library files. An installer may follow shortly. 

Since the PowerTools is a collection of tools, we can update specific tool updates here as well.

(24-Oct-2011) CountItems released as version 1.1. No installer just yet, but functionality is intact.
