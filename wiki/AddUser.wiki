#summary Adds a new context menu item when viewing the users list which allows creating a new user based on a manually entered string.

= Introduction =
In some environments it takes a very long time to browse the active directory or LDAP repository. This makes adding new users a slow or impossible task. This new context menu item makes adding new users very easy.

= GUI Example =

https://tridion-2011-power-tools.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/AddUser.png

==Description==
To add a user directly (from a domain or directory service), navigate to the users list, and right click to get a context menu in blank area of the list view. Under the PowerTools menu there is a new 'Add 'Non-Domain' user. When you click this you will be prompted to enter a DOMAIN\Username.

Note that this tool is only available if the performer of the task normally has access to create new users.

== Audience ==
Admins and Power Users
