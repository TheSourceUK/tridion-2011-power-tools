#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

Vesa mentioned:
 * Unit Test Suite (Beside their obvious function tests are also the 
best documentation for developers) 
   NUnit is the most popular choice between collaborators and one of the most widely known.
 * NAnt/Maven script (Could work as a sort of an installer) 

Dominic mentioned [http://seleniumhq.org/ Selenium] for front-end testing. These create JavaScript-powered client side testing scripts that we could  re-use and possibly share to walk through a browser such as the CME.
