= Introduction =

Tridion consultants and developers come from a variety of backgrounds and amount of experience. Even the most experienced programers may not use the same tools. This wiki page let's us share example tools, plugins, and related information to smooth out the development process.

We want more time to focus on requirements and code by making the tools part easy!

Add info for fellow developers that need info on related SVN clients, VMs, IDEs, refactoring tools, and even UI shortcuts. 

== Tools ==
  * [SourceControl#Tortoise Tortoise] (Explorer-based) or [SourceControl#ankhsvn ankhsvn] (Visual Studio) for ways to connect to the SVN-based source
    * Can also edit wiki pages "offline" (Suggestion by Dominic)
  * Resharper for refactoring (application for free license TBD)
  * Visio for diagrams
  * http://www.websequencediagrams.com/ for swim lane or sequence diagrams
  * IRC http://webchat.freenode.net/ channel #tridion<br/>IRC may be quiet now, but will likely pick up as we get into more development -- use the forum and wiki for now. Email a lead if you're interested in joining the Skype chat.

== Browsers ==
  * The CME is very dependent on browser cache. Tip to clear cache in Chrome: CTRL-Shift-DEL (this domain only?).
  * You can also disable Firefox cache by writing "about:config" in the address bar and setting network.http.use-cache to false.


== Frameworks and Languages ==
Some topics you might want to learn about or share your expertise in.

  * JavaScript, JQuery, Anguilla...
  * ASP.NET
  * Model View Controller (MVC)...
    * On virtual directories: In IIS under WebUI\Models and WebUI\Editors, both should have a virutal directory called CME under them.
  * About GUI extensions for Tridion 2011
  * Tridion 2011 SP1 delta info
