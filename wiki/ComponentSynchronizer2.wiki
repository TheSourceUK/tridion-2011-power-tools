#summary This page describes the new approach for the Component Synchronizer Power Tool

= Introduction =

The goal of this tool is to synchronize existing content in the CMS against a schema that has been changed 'after' the content was created. For such a reason, the tool needs to provide with reference content to be added/removed/updated from the 'old' content with the new structure based on the latest version of the Schema the content is based on.

The original tool was showing a form where the user could enter the content (and metadata) using a form that was generated by the tool. This approach brought up several issues like:
 * RTF fields rely on the Ribbon Tool bar (it's where the RTF tools are shown) and the tool would have to implement it. 
 * Existing extensions won't be available in the tool, unless they would be implemented.
 * We were reinventing the wheel: Why do we need a new View if there is already the Component View that copes with all the requirements for Content Creation?

Said this, the new approach uses the Component View for content creation, meaning that when I want to synchronize content based on a given schema, the Power User will have to create a "reference" component, i.e. a Component based on the schema we want to synchronize providing with the reference data, stuff like default values for missing fields, for example.
