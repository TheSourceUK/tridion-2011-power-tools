= Introduction =

||Audience||Suggested implementation||Original Developer||Priority||Difficulty||Status||Notes||
||Power User||Context Menu on Schema||Willem-Jan van den Bichelaer & Quirijn Slings||Highest priority||Hard||(development approaches being done in parallel||Let's start with the hardest, most useful tool (utility is subjective, but at least two or more have asked for this and PagePublisher)||

The goal of this tool is to synchronize existing content in the CMS against a schema that has been updated 'after' the content was created. For such a reason, the tool needs to provide with reference content to be added/removed/updated from the 'old' content with the new structure based on the latest version of the Schema the content is based on.

The tool requirements are available [http://code.google.com/p/tridion-2011-power-tools/wiki/ComponentSynchronizer here]


= New Approach =
The original tool design shows a form where the user could enter the content (and metadata) using a form that was generated by the tool. This approach brought up several issues like:
 * RTF fields rely on the Ribbon Tool bar (it's where the RTF tools are shown) and the tool would have to implement it. 
 * Existing extensions won't be available in the tool, unless they would be implemented.
 * We were reinventing the wheel: Why do we need a new View if there is already the Component View that copes with all the requirements for Content Creation?

Said this, the new approach uses the Component View for content creation, meaning that when I want to synchronize content based on a given schema, the Power User will have to create a "reference" component, i.e. a Component based on the schema we want to synchronize providing with the reference data, stuff like default values for missing fields, for example.

The user can create a Reference component without using the tool and then browse it from the tool as well. The tool will provide with an option to launch the New Component (reference) creation, though.


= New Features =

The new approach will add the following features:

  * Launch the Component Syncrhonizer from a Schema 
  * Launch the Component Syncrhonizer from a Component 
  * Launch the Component Syncrhonizer from a Selection (within a list)
  * Launch the Component Syncrhonizer from a Search, by selecting the results
