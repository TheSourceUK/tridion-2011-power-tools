Description

This tool allows the user to launch all the pages contained in a publication or structure group. The main difference with the normal publication is that items are sent to the publishing queue as individual transactions, therefore allowing to identify those that are failing and not blocking the whole publication job, in case that an item fails.

== Audience ==
admin, developer and power user
