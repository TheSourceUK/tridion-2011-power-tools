#Component Synchronizer Requirement Gathering

= Introduction =

This tool was originally created to solve the problems derived from a schema design change, when there is already content created using it.
This page intends to gather requirements in order to start generating a functional design.


= Requirements Overview =
|| ID || Description || Scope || Comments ||
|| 1 ||Provided an Schema, Component Synchronizer should be able to set default values for itÂ´s fields in all components using the schema.|| || ||
|| 2 ||Provided an Schema, Component Synchronizer should remove(hide) those fields no longer existing from all components using it. || || ||
|| 3 ||There should be no data loss. If a field is removed, and the component synchronizer is used to remove a field from a component, the data contained in that field should be able to be retrieved if the same field is added again.|| || ||
|| 4 ||Component synchronizer should retrieve all the schema fields, and display them to the user, so the user can enter the default values to be set|| || ||
