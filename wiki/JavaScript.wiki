= Chrome =

 # Open page or start pop-up.
 # Use CTRL+SHIFT+I to open the Developer tools (CTRL+SHIFT+J to jump straight to the JavaScript console).
 # Select a script from the top-left dropdown and set a breakpoint by right-clicking on the left-side numbered lines.
 # Close the console (CTRL+W to close any Chrome tab/pop-up)
 # Re-run the page or pop-up and press CTRL+SHIFT+I to trigger the breakpoint.

= Allow Breakpoints =
