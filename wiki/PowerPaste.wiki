#summary A better "paste special" button for SDL Tridion

= Introduction =

The out-of-the-box Paste Special button does not work with Chrome due to browser restrictions on accessing the clipboard from Javascript, and it seems that a future Firefox version might also remove access to the clipboard.

A better way to deal with cleaning up the content (the whole point of "Paste Special" would be to:

 # "Power Paste" Button. Clicking on it opens a modal dialog with a resizable textbox, user is asked to use CTRL-V to paste the content in this textbox
 # A couple of buttons in the dialog allow to modify the text inside it â€“ remove markup, remove css, etc (same features as today)
 # OK or Finished button takes this manipulated/cleaned up text and inserts it in the original field & cursor position
 # Similar approach to work with Experience Manager (most of the dialog code should be the same)
