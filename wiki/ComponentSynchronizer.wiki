#summary PowerTools Requirements - ComponentSynchronizer (active)
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design,Featured

= Introduction =
This tool was originally created to solve the problems derived from a schema design change with existing content.

This tools has been requested by multiple contributors and is one of the most important for implementors to have so it as been marked as *High priority*.

The implementation of the tool will be complex, and faces multiple challenges including performance. 

= Details =

||Suggested implementation||Original Developer||Priority||Difficulty||Status||Notes||
||Context Menu on Schema||Willem-Jan van den Bichelaer & Quirijn Slings||Highest priority||Hard||(development approaches being done in parallel||Let's start with the hardest, most useful tool (utility is subjective, but at least two or more have asked for this and PagePublisher)||

This tool synchronizes existing content in the CMS against a schema that has been updated 'after' the content was created. For such a reason, the tool needs to provide with reference content to be added/removed/updated from the 'old' content with the new structure based on the latest version of the Schema the content is based on.

==Description==
Synchronize item fields based on a user-selected schema.

== Audience ==
* Admins and Power Users looking to match components to their schema before Content Port

= Functional Requirements =
{{{Tool = Component Synchronizer}}}
|| ID || Description || Scope || Comments ||
|| 1 ||Provided a Schema, Tool will set default values for its fields in all components based on the schema. Existing values will not be overwritten unless the overwrite (or override) checkbox is checked.|| || ||
|| 2 ||Provided a Schema, Tool should remove ~~(hide)~~ fields no longer existing from all components using it. This occurs in the CME upon change, save & close. Component Synchronizer needs to do the same. || || ||
|| 3 ||~~There should be no data loss. If a field is removed, and the component synchronizer is used to remove a field from a component, the data contained in that field should be able to be retrieved if the same field is added again.~~|| Requirement Dropped || Use rollback to return to or see previous fields. ||
|| 4 || Using a "reference component" Tool will retrieve the schema fields, display them to the user, so the user can enter the default values to be set|| || We'll accomplish using a reference component. ||
|| 5 || The tool should only be available to CMS Administrators || ||  ||
|| 6 || Tool should do a partial update for components that can not be updated in a single request. Tool should log failures with tcm id and problem field(s).  || ||  ||
|| 7 || Tool works in the context of a single publication. It uses the shared schema definition and reference component from selected publication. It will ignore localized children items and parents, but update in-Publication shared and localized items. || || ||
|| 8  || Tool will save component after it validates against the schema or log issues (see #6). ||  ||  ||
|| 9 || Tool should detect and fix fields out-of-order, re-ordering fields to the reference component to ensure Req #8. ||  ||  ||
|| 10 || Richtext-to-text behavior should match the CME behavior (what happens to existing component RTF when schema changes to plain text?)  ||  ||  ||
|| 11 || Advanced requirement - how to handle min/max and other schema attribute changes? ||  ||  ||
|| 12 || See below for behavior on "somewhat-compatible" changes ||  ||  ||
|| 13 || Tool should prompt and stop if user selects schema with attached workflow. User must manually un-associate workflow before proceeding.  ||  ||  ||
|| 14 || Tool should run rich text against the schema XSLT filter if possible, mimicking the CME. || || If possible ||
|| 15 || Changes to allowed formatting or styles will not affect the tool. || || The CME allows manually entered styles or formatting. The tool will match this. ||



What should the behaviors be for same-named schema changes for the following:
 * Selection box to drop-down (multiple items to one)
 * Selection box to radio (multiple items to one, now mandatory)

Non-issue changes--Tool will save existing text (test to be sure).
 * Selection box to check box (multiple items to multiple)
 * Drop-down to selection box
 * Drop-down to radio
 * Drop-down to check box
 * Radio to selection box
 * Radio to check box
 * Radio to drop-down
 * Check box to selection box
 * Check box to radio
 * Check box to radio
 * Plain text to rich text
 * Rich text to plain text~~

== UI ==

= Approach =
Peter Kjaer merged Jaime's changes into \trunk. This branch addresses the following.

 * RTF fields rely on the Ribbon Tool bar (it's where the RTF tools are shown) and the tool would have to implement it. 
 * Existing extensions won't be available in the tool, unless they would be implemented.
 * Re-use existing the Component View that copies with all the requirements for Content Creation

Approach uses the Component View for content creation, meaning that when I want to synchronize content based on a given schema, the Power User will have to create a "reference" component, i.e. a Component based on the schema we want to synchronize providing with the reference data, stuff like default values for missing fields, for example.

The user can create a Reference component without using the tool and then browse it from the tool as well. The tool will provide with an option to launch the New Component (reference) creation, though.


= Features =

Built UI features:
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Schema
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Component (reference component or "to-be-synched" component?)
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Selection (within a list)
  * Launch the Component Synchronizer from a Search, by selecting the results 

= Screenshots =
