#summary Standards - Code

Use existing guidelines, Clean Code by "Uncle Bob" Martin, and the appropriate frameworks/languages (Anguilla, MSDN's suggestions for C#, etc).

Coding guidelines for JavaScript / CSS:
  * [CodingGuidelines_Anguilla Tridion CME guidelines]

= Compiled Code =
Coding guidelines for C#:
  * [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx Microsoft's  .NET 4.0 Design Guidelines] 
  * Some further details discussed on [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2005/01/26/361363.aspx Brad Abrahm's blog]. 

General code layout:
  * Avoid copyright / author statement at the top of each file. Maintain this information here, in a readme, or other obvious place.
  * Add "using" statements at the top of files, removing unreferenced statements (no unused imports).
  * Order members from unchanging, more private aspects of a class to the more public behaviors and attributes. Example:
   # fields
   # constructors
   # events
   # properties
   # methods
 * Further sort members by visibility:
   # private
   # protected, 
   # internal
   # public, etc. 

The most "interesting," worked-on, and more visible (public) code will tend to be at the bottom of your code files.

Also:
  * *Add comments!* Especially public methods and members.
  * Consider ReSharper or CodeRush Xpress (free)
