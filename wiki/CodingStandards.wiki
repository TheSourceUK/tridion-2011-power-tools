= Introduction =

Braver souls have discussed coding standards.


= Details =

We have some good ideas from the team including existing guidelines, Clean Code by "Uncle Bob" Martin, and following the chosen frameworks/languages (Anguilla, MSDN's suggestions for C#, etc).

Add ideas here and perhaps we can work out the details on the IRC #tridion channel (http://webchat.freenode.net/) or through the wiki's comments.
